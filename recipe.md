Heat the oven to 350Â°F. Grease and lightly flour two 9-inch round baking trays or one 13x9x2-inch baking tray.
Stir together the sugar, flour, cocoa, baking soda, baking powder and salt in a large bowl. Add the eggs, buttermilk, coffee liquid, and vanilla; beat thoroughly (batter should be thin). Pour batter evenly into the prepared baking trays.
Bake for 30 to 35 minutes for round trays, 35 to 40 minutes for rectangular tray or until a wooden pick inserted in the center comes out clean. Cool in the tray for about 10 minutes then remove from the trays onto wire racks. Cool completely. Decorate as desired.
